# Abled Not Disabled

This app focuses on the development of a learning disability (LD) childâ€™s cognitive abilities.
It has three fundamental games whose focus is to sharpen auditory, hand to eye coordination and specific mental
abilities. A planetary in-game encourages the child to keep the planets, which constantly change direction, in orbit.
This activity not only improves his/her hand-eye coordination but also improves their knowledge of the solar system.
Musical games focus on specific strokes which sharpen the auditory skills of a LD child.
For example, guitar strokes are known to improve long term memory and increase mental alertness.
The piano improves movement, hearing, and visuospatial abilities. Numeral activities such as number counting,
addition and subtraction, and multiplication are also used to improve the speed of information
processing and working memory in the child.

This repository is split up into two parts. The 'APKFile' folder
contains the .apk for the app, while 'ProjectFiles' contains
the Unity scripts and source code.
